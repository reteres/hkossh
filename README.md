　　这幅画构图洗练，用笔细腻简洁，境界开阔而丰富，给人一种峻爽明丽的感觉。我常常被画仲的风景感染，把自己想象成画中那个凭栏远眺的人，有一种悠远开阔之气在心头回荡。
　　我希望洱海因我的祝祷而永生。
我从四川省境内的泸沽湖镇环湖重返云南境内的落水村，晚霞归去，泸沽湖畔，只留住渔火的星星点点，摩梭阿夏美丽的化装,阿注风致风骚倜地派对。泸沽湖畔，营火熊熊，欢声笑语、沧海汉篦，咱们顾不得跋山涉水，介入个中,仍旧激动，仍旧漫不经心。
Life is like a play, is no less costumes and masks.
Some people say that there is always a mask is wear the other people see.
With a lavish costume, wearing a mask of perseverance.
What starts with luxury, but with loneliness.
Had long wanted to write about one of my colleagues.
For the purpose of respect, not to mention names, temporarily to Z jun said, after all it people gossip is not a good thing, if he know he will be very not happy, our relationship is not once upon a time, I don't want to make our fragile friendship further deterioration, eventually become as hopeless as tumor.
Because the person in this world is the need for friendship, a person does not care about the friendship is sad, unless he numerous friends to come over.
I am very cherish our this friendship.
But honestly, in the last few years he was very impatient and I seem to live, he don't care what I do, I rarely listen to him.
We have heaps of problems need to deal with, look at each other and helpless, so we are behind closed doors, sweep the snow from his own doorstep.
Fortunately, he didn't get to the Internet, when I want to copy something was eventually I take to hang on the Internet, he may not see the rest of my life, and for most people, he is still a blur.
He didn't remember anything to others.
I want to also can not find any reason to let other people remember him, he is a boring, boring like my words.
